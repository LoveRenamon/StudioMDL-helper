# StudioMDL-helper 
A ugly bash script implementation for help compile **Source Engine** mdl files.  
And why in hell I would need this? Well, I don't wanna need to launch wait and decorate many different files since I keep all my `vProjects` into a single folder called `"0xdecompiled"`  
  
With my poorly skills I this to help me. 


## How to use: 
  - Download this script and put where you wish to. (I put directly at `$HOME/.local/bin` to directly call from terminal)  
  - Edit as required with your local paths, since mostly people have their own different methods 
  - Start the script, and follow the instructions 
   
 Left 4 Dead 2 won't work with default wine and need steam runtime active, as workaround I added a special option `lc` to specially use `Proton 4.11`
